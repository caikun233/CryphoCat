Encrypt your chatting with me, meow~

Currently only Simplified Chinese and English are supported.

* Support asymmetric encryption of arbitrary length text, currently using RSA2048 (I want to make it optional, but the development energy is not here).
* The key directory generation rules in the "two-person chat" scenario have been built in. According to the MIT open source agreement, you can modify the code yourself to achieve your desired purpose.
* All offline processing, and open source, do not upload any data, decoupled from the chat software.
* As long as your chat software can guarantee that the information sent and received is the same, then the content of your communication will never be revealed.
* **Not Support Audio/Video At All, Unless there is a way to convert audio/video to text**.
* You can base64 encode the picture and send it out, and I may add the base64 encoding function to the software later. ~~Only idoits send images like this, just telling others what you want to say and don't use the xxxxing images.~~

## INSTALLATION & USAGE

### Linux / Windows CLIüî®

 1. I coded over Python3.10.9 & Windows 10 x64. You'd better install Python3.10 First.

 2. Just download CLI.py and 

    ```
    python CLI.py
    ```

 3. The program will automatically create a folder named "RSAkeys" in the same level directory, and create a folder of "my" and "friend" in it to distinguish the key between you and the chat partner.

 4. The program only support zh-CN till y2023/m07/d01. I will upload EN version soon, so no more explanation here.

### Windows GUI üî®

1. **The GUI version has not been developed yet, and no releases are currently available.**
2. ~~Download lastest .exe file from [releases](https://github.com/caikun233/CryphoCat/releases) and **no x86 support, x64 only**.~~
3. ~~Double click exe file, it looks ugly, right? I am not good at any art, but I will try my best to make it more beautiful.~~
4. ~~The first text entry box is your friend's public key's path you want to input. The 2nd text entry box is where you input words to encrypt or decrypt.~~
5. ~~Also, The program only support zh-CN till y2023/m07/d01. I will upload EN version soon, so no more explanation here.~~

## Development Plan

- [ ] Add English support for releases and source code.
- [ ] Finish GUI version development.
- [ ] Make RSA key length optional.
- [ ] Make GUI more beautiful.
- [ ] Try to add images base64 encode.
- [ ] Let the encrypted text be copied automatically.
